## Setup Instructions

### Prerequisites
- .NET 6 or later
- SQL Server (Local or Azure)
- Entity Framework Core Tools

### Database Setup
1. **Update Connection String**: Modify `appsettings.Development.json` with your SQL Server connection string
2. **Apply Migrations**: Run `dotnet ef database update --project MH.Infrastructure --startup-project MH.Api`
3. **Seed Initial Data**: Execute the SQL scripts in `DatabaseManagement/` folder:
   - `initial-db-value.sql` (Basic setup)
   - `ndcangu-seed-data.sql` (NDCANGU features data)

### Running the API
```bash
cd MH.Api
dotnet run
```

The API will be available at `https://localhost:5001` (HTTPS) or `http://localhost:5000` (HTTP).

### API Documentation
